FFXIV Rotation Tool is a Python application designed to help players of the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV), learn effective rotations for different characters in boss fights. This tool automates the process of gathering player-used rotations and presents them to the user in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.  

The application consists of several key components:  

* Web scraping: The tool uses Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape web pages where players share their in-game rotations for specific boss fights. This data is collected and stored for further processing.

* Data parsing: The collected data is then parsed and converted into a custom file format that is tailored for the application's needs. This involves identifying relevant information, such as character class, rotation sequence, and boss fight, and organizing it in a structured format.

* Visualization: The parsed data is displayed to the user in a revolving belt-like system. This unique visualization allows users to quickly and easily grasp the rotations for new characters in the game. The interactive interface enables users to switch between character classes and boss fights to explore different rotations.

* Virtual environment (venv): The project uses Python's built-in venv module to create an isolated environment for the application. This ensures that the required libraries and dependencies are contained within the project, making it easier to share, deploy, and manage the application without interfering with other Python projects or the system's Python installation.  

To summarize, the FFXIV Rotation Tool is a helpful Python application that streamlines the process of learning character rotations in Final Fantasy XIV boss fights. By leveraging web scraping, data parsing, and an intuitive visualization, the tool allows players to quickly understand and adopt effective rotations, improving their in-game performance. The use of venv ensures that the project remains manageable and self-contained, simplifying deployment and maintenance.
