# FFXIV Rotation Tool
## Project Overview
This project's goal was to create an overlapping window which would be scrolling in-game ability icons. Ideally making it quicker to learn basic rotations for new jobs in-game. 

## Main features:
* Always on top borderless
* Web-scraping
* File parsing
* Abstracted
* Visual
* Automation

## Achievements
The project turned out better than expected! It expadited my learning process for new classes. It was expanded beyond it's original scope to ingest the worlds best players rotations so I could see in real-time how the pro's would approach a fight.
